# Thought Process
> When solving the given problem, I ensured I thoroughly read the details regarding the task. I skimmed through the dashboard template and completed the setup while making sure there were no errors when running the template. Since I am not yet familiar with GridStack, I reviewed the documentation on how to integrate it properly with Vue. Additionally, I revisited Vue 3 documentation, as the last time I worked with Vue was three years ago.

Following the guidance in GridStack's documentation, I improvised fro their examples to meet the provided requirements. I began by implementing all the required functionalities before focusing on styling the elements. Initially, I planned to extract the widget code block into a separate component to enhance the project's flexibility. However, I encountered issues and decided to retain the current version, as reviewing the intricacies of Vue 3 would require additional time.
